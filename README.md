 * Passengers can avail the facility of passes to commute using public service vehicles. These passes are prone to forging and may be used by someone else also. An innovative solution may be developed to transform it to paperless pass and secure it through ICT solution so no other person can use the same pass. Sample Data Required – No Existing system – 
 * a) Paper based passes (Daily/Weekly/Fortnightly/Monthly/Quarterly/Half-Yearly/Yearly) for various types of buses (A.C/Non AC/Inter-State/Airport Express, etc.) are collected at counters. 
 * b) Bus passes are printed on papers, which may be stolen, forged and used by someone else. 
 * c) Difficult for bus conductors to verify the pass manually. Stake holders – may include General Citizens for normal passes students, disabled persons, freedom fighters, national awardees, sports persons, etc. for concessional passes Road transport staff for pass issuance and bus conductors for pass verification. Innovative solution to automate the process – Automatic pass issuance without manual intervention.
  * d) Can an automatic system be developed to obtain a digital bus pass, which may be sent to a person’s mobile directly? Securing the digital pass .
  * e) Can the digital pass by intact to a person’s identity so that it may not be used by anyone else? f) Can the digital pass be made secure enough to prevent any forging? Easy verification of digital pass 
  * g) Can a solution be developed for bus conductors to verify the digital pass easily? Recharging the passes with ease 
  * h) Can an intimation be sent to the person in advance regarding expiry of pass? Expected outcome – 
  * i) Paper less bus passes 
  * j) Secure and less vulnerable pass 
  * k) Easy verification of digital passes by conductors
